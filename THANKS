============ Thanks! ============
=================================

   First, a big thank you to all the people who help me test and debug this 
   code. It sometimes gets frustrating to receive hundreds of messages 
   saying "it doesn't work!", but they are useful all the same...

   Andre Baresel (baresel@informatik.hu-berlin.de),
   and Craig Jackson (Craig.Jackson@launchpad.unc.edu),
   provided a tremendous amount of information about SB hardware.

   Charles Sandmann (sandmann@clio.rice.edu),
   DJ Delorie (dj@delorie.com),
   Eli Zaretskii (eliz@is.elta.co.il),
   and everyone else who has contributed to djgpp. I love it.

   Creative Labs.
   Come on, let us not hold any grudges :-) They may have been evil tyrants 
   in the past, but they were really quite helpful while George was writing 
   the AWE driver...

   C. Schwerdtfeger (schwerdt@physics.ubc.ca),
   for his help (and enourmous patience!) in getting the SB Pro-I MIDI 
   driver to work.

   Finn Thoegersen, Nordbanevej 3 C, DK-7800 Skive, Denmark.
   Most of my SVGA hardware information came from his VGADOC package.

   Eric Jorgensen (smeagol@rt66.com).
   Varmint's Audio Tools (VAT) gave me many useful ideas about how to play 
   MIDI files.

   Jamie O'Connell (JamieOConnell@msn.com).
   Several of the new Adlib drum patches, and the specifications for the 
   .IBK file format, came from his SBTimbre package.

   Jean-Paul Mikkers (mikmak@stack.urc.tue.nl).
   MikMod was the source of a lot of information about programming the SB, 
   and also gave me the idea of dynamically reprogramming the PIT to get a 
   really high resolution timer.

   Joel H. Hunter (jhunter@kendaco.telebyte.com).
   His SB library for djgpp is excellent, and helped me a lot.

   John Pollard (74723.1626@compuserve.com).
   The FM instrument definitions are based on his MID-KIT library.

   Kendall Bennett and all the other cool people at SciTech Software.
   These guys gave the world UniVBE, the VBE/AF API, and a lot of free 
   information and example VESA code. Plus they very kindly sent me a copy 
   of the VBE/AF spec when I wanted one.

   Kris Heidenstrom (kheidens@actrix.gen.nz).
   His PC timing FAQ was a big help.

   Mark Feldman.
   It goes without saying that the PCGPE was an invaluable resource.

   Michael Abrash.
   You just gotta love that man...

   Paul Fenwick (bg914@freenet.carleton.ca).
   Various bits of the mode-X code (notably the split screen stuff) came 
   from his XLIBDJ library.

   Robert Schmidt (robert@stud.unit.no).
   The register values for the 400x* mode-X resolutions came from his TWEAK 
   program.

   Tom Grandgent (tgrand@canvaslink.com).
   Organised and hosted the Allegro mailing list. Hurrah!

   Vladimir Arnost (xarnos00@dcse.fee.vutbr.cz).
   Provided hardware specs for the OPL3 chip.

   Frank Zappa, Pink Floyd, the Doors, Tori Amos, and all the other great 
   musicians who provide me with things to listen to while I am programming.

   My parents, John and Nancy.
   I would never have made it through all those late night coding sessions 
   without the cafetiere they gave me last Christmas :-)
